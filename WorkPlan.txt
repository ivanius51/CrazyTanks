	GameLoop order - 
		Initialization once 
		in loop 
			timer start
			phisics (check collision, update paths, etc)
			User input (command pattern)
			Game logic - simple AI
			Graphics render in three layers - draw buffer(bitmap), to buffer: preRender(map from bitmap layer), Render(objects layer), PostRender(GUI layer) - to buffer.
			timer end
			delay or calculate FPS and Draw time
		End loop
		Finalization once
	Colisions - check if player(movable object) try move to not wallable tile then start broken animation.
	AI path calculate wia BFS (breadth-first search) and move to player or move in random side until wallable way, until not find player in intersection
	Commands - turn left/right, move forward/backward, shoot, take damage, stop.
	Graphics - use primitives like square, line, triangle, circle etc. Use winapi bitblt, bitmaps, gdi.
		Global params 
			Tiles count
			Tile size in px or screen size/resolution
		Objects 
			Wall - 0.75 square size from main map tile (filled??)
			Tank - 0.9 square size from main tile with barrel 0.1 line
			bullet - 0.25 of tile size or 2.5 of tank barrel length
		Animation
			Move forward - from tile to tile.
			Move forward  to wall - brake, stops and move backward.
			Turn in one tile.
			Bullet flying
			--
			Shoot
			Taking damage - bang
			--
		GUI
			Time from start - top,left corner.
			Score - player kills - top,right corner.
			Lifes - player have 3 lives from start - top,right corner close Score.
		Methods
			Turn bitmap wia plgblt
			Draw bitmap wia bitblt
			Translate bitmap wia bitblt
			Draw objects wia MoveTo,LineTo
	Классы:
		Command (pattern)
		GameObject
			Graphic
				Primitive
				Prerendered	
		
		GameObject
			Point Offcet
			Point Tile
		
		map - array [Tile count, tile count] of GameObjects
		bullet - Primitive
		tank - Prerendered
		wall - Primitive
